# eth\_getTransactionReceipt

Returns the receipt of a transaction by transaction hash.

**Note** That the receipt is not available for pending transactions.

**Parameters**

1. `DATA`, 32 Bytes - hash of a transaction

```js
params: ["0xb903239f8543d04b5dc1ba6579132b143087c68db1b2168786408fcbce568238"]
```

**Returns** `Object` - A transaction receipt object, or `null` when no receipt was found:

* `transactionHash` : `DATA`, 32 Bytes - hash of the transaction.
* `transactionIndex`: `QUANTITY` - integer of the transactions index position in the block.
* `blockHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - hash of the block where this transaction was in.
* `blockNumber`: `QUANTITY` - block number where this transaction was in.
* `from`: `DATA`, 20 Bytes - address of the sender.
* `to`: `DATA`, 20 Bytes - address of the receiver. null when its a contract creation transaction.
* `cumulativeGasUsed` : `QUANTITY` - The total amount of gas used when this transaction was executed in the block.
* `gasUsed` : `QUANTITY` - The amount of gas used by this specific transaction alone.
* `contractAddress` : `DATA`, 20 Bytes - The contract address created, if the transaction was a contract creation, otherwise `null`.
* `logs`: `Array` - Array of log objects, which this transaction generated.
* `logsBloom`: `DATA`, 256 Bytes - Bloom filter for light clients to quickly retrieve related logs. It also returns _either_ :
* `root` : `DATA` 32 bytes of post-transaction stateroot (pre Byzantium)
* `status`: `QUANTITY` either `1` (success) or `0` (failure)
