# Subscription methods



Subscription methods are available for WebSocket connections only, and allow you to wait for events instead of polling for them. For example, dapps can subscribe to logs and receive notifications when a specific event occurs.

The following subscription methods are available:

* [`eth_subscribe`](eth\_subscribe.md) - Create a subscription to a particular event
* [`eth_unsubscribe`](eth\_unsubscribe.md) - Cancel an active subscription
